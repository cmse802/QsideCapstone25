# About QSIDE's Toy Data

This is the link to access our toy data. LINK!

We followed the *Installing_Excel.docx* LINK! to create a new Excel sheet for our toy data. We created multiple sheets to maintain organization with all the data we were generating.

Our toy dataset consists of five different Excel sheets, covering:
- Student demographics
- Metadata
- Individual school trajectories
- School demographics
- Student school presence

It includes 25 fake students with attributes. Additionally, it incorporates data from six real Illinois schools and 80 fake excused absence letters to mimic real-world attendance records. All the variables included in our toy dataset were discussed with our community partners and are listed in the *MSU - ACT NOW Data Map* LINK! under the *School Presence Data Map* sheet.

We used this outline to structure the sheets and variables for our toy dataset. Through multiple meetings with community partners, we refined and adjusted the data to better fit our needs.

With a clear framework of required variables and values, we leveraged ChatGPT to generate randomized data for most columns and sheets. A document detailing the prompts used is available here. Student addresses and real Illinois schools were manually generated.

Once the toy dataset was created, we followed the *Exporting Excel files* guide found in *Installing_Excel.docx* to export and save it locally. The toy dataset Excel file was then used to extract the GeoIDs and mapping in Tableau.
