# Act-NOW: Community Health Index Project

Welcome to the Act-NOW: Community Health Index repository! This project leverages data science to tackle critical social issues such as gun-related violence, opioid addiction, and truancy. By developing a Community Health Index, we aim to provide actionable insights to improve community well-being and foster collaboration between local communities and law enforcement.

# About the Project

This project is part of a broader effort by the QSIDE Institute and its Act-NOW initiative to address tensions between communities of color and law enforcement, which uses quantative methods to focus on:

1.) Identifying and analyzing key issues affecting community health.

2.) Developing a standardized Community Health Index using metrics like mean income, health indicators, and employment rates.

3.) Visualizing the data in a way that is accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, including social justice activists and policymakers.
