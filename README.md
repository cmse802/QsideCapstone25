# Act-NOW: Community Health Index Project

Welcome to the Act-NOW QSIDE student repository! This project leverages data science to tackle critical social issues such as the driving forces behind chronic absenteeism. 

# About the Project

This project is part of a broader effort by the QSIDE Institute and its Act-NOW initiative to address tensions between communities of color and law enforcement, which uses quantative methods to focus on:

3.) Visualizing the data in a way that is accessible to the public in an open source manner
