# Act-NOW: Data Mapping Project

Welcome to the Act-NOW QSIDE student repository! This project leverages data science to tackle critical social issues such as the driving forces behind chronic absenteeism. 

# About the Project

This project is part of a broader effort by the QSIDE Institute and its Act-NOW initiative to address the following key points:

1.) Identifying and analyzing key issues affecting chronic absenteeism

2.) Utilizing Tableau to create relevant data maps using unique toy data

3.) Visualizing the data in a way that is accessible to the public in an open source manner
