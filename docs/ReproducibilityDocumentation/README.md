# Qside's Reproducibility Documentation
This document provides a comprehensive guide to reproducing each figure (mainly Tableau sheets) included in our project, detailing the steps, code, and tools used. We include instruction files that outline how each Tableau sheet was generated. Our documentation covers key aspects of the project, starting with the creation of a toy dataset, including a description of the process and the dataset itself. We then provide instructions on extracting geographic identifiers (GeoIDs) using a script that interacts with the U.S. Census Geocoder API, allowing others to replicate this step and extract GeoIDs for other locations. Finally, we detail the process of loading both the toy dataset and the generated GeoIDs into Tableau to reproduce our visualization, which maps school locations and presents key metrics such as SAT averages and the number of unexcused absences. Each figure in our project is accompanied by a corresponding instruction file to ensure complete transparency and reproducibility, enabling others to validate and build upon our work. 

## The Toy Dataset
The toy dataset was created due to the lack of real data, serving as a structured example to guide future data collection. It consists of five Excel sheets covering student demographics, metadata, school trajectories, school demographics, and attendance. The dataset includes 25 fictional students with attributes like name, address, race/ethnicity, birthdate, siblings, socioeconomic status, and food insecurity levels. It also incorporates data from six real Illinois schools and 80 fake excused absence letters to simulate attendance records.
